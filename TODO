- Incorrectly implemented:
    Use auth permissions for authors instead of boolean field
    Use widgets instead of directly writing forms inside the templates
    Refactor entire template tags
- API
    API should be a different app, or should it?
- Admin
    Create model admins specific per model
- MISC
    Find a reason to live
    Remove the need to init for the urls
    Create a site map in so that js doesn't need hardcoded urls
    use light.standard.css as the base of dark.standard.css, currently they are not the same
- Localization
    Start implementing il8n
